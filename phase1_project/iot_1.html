                    <p>Advances in sensor technologies and computing capabilities coupled with reduction in prices has led to an exponential increase in the number of “things” connected to the internet. As a result of it, there is an increased adoption of sensor fusion and edge computing systems across industries, from autonomous vehicles to agriculture.</p>

                    <p>Manufacturing industries would be an early adopter of sensor fusion and edge computing to enable existing IoT implementations in order to bring speed and agility in production workflows in real-time. Smart industrial robots deployed on factory floors could become more responsive and self-sufficient if they are able to process data at the edge. These could facilitate quicker extraction of insight and increased application of machine learning algorithms.</p>
                    
                    <p>Smart farming could be another area where IoT in combination with sensor fusion and edge computing can bring efficiencies. More often than not, these agricultural farms are located at remote and hostile locations which result in connectivity and bandwidth issues. In such scenarios, edge computing can help smart farms to effectively monitor temperature, equipment health, and overall processes to take preemptive actions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Oil and gas industry is another industry which has a significant number of IoT devices and sensors. Oil and gas rigs deploy over 10,000 sensors and all these data are accumulated and transmitted to a cloud network. Some of the data captured are just meant to signify whether the system is functioning properly or not. In such a scenario, an edge computing system could locally compile and analyze the information and only the overall system report along with the important data could be sent across to a cloud network at the end of the day reducing the data traversing the network.</p>
                    
                    <p>Autonomous vehicle industry would also be an early adopter due to its need for real-time decision making functionalities in self-driving vehicles. With improvements in AI algorithms, sensor technology and computing capabilities, companies like Waymo, Tesla and Audi among others are investing heavily on autonomous vehicles. These vehicles utilize a wide variety of technology and sensors, such as radar, GPS, LIDAR, odometry etc., to analyze and detect the surroundings, and make decisions on its own, keeping safety a priority, while navigating. Signals from these wide variety of sensors are integrated to estimate the position and type of object (i.e. human beings, animals, other cars etc.), the velocity at which the object is moving and the trajectory of the movements. To merge all these sensor information, companies implement a technique called sensor fusion.       </p>
