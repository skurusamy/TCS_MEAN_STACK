                    Chatbots for Better Customer Experience in Air Travel</div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>Most passengers will agree that communicating with airlines is often not a very pleasant experience, especially when in distress like a missed flight, re-booking, infant requirement, missed baggage, refunds, receipts, or any of the innumerable possible concerns. Though major airlines today employ thousands of on-call customer service reps, calling the customer care number often means navigating through number of interactive voice responses before speaking to an agent or getting the requested information. Queries over email can take longer and does not provide the kind of instant gratification that customers expect in today’s modern digital lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>There are several reasons for poor customer service experience, and one primary reason is that information is held by multiple entities within an airline – reservation, operations, commercial, loyalty. While each of them may be aware of the information relevant to them, it’s nearly impossible for one desk or department to provide a single comprehensive service to respond to all queries from a customer without a handoff.</p>
                    
                    <p>Compounding the problem is that as events unfold in real time, which is commonly the case for much of the grievance calls, airlines are often clueless about who is impacted and to what extent, and how to pre-empt the customer service call through better intelligence. Considering that airline business is also highly seasonal, with significant spikes and troughs during holidays and abrupt weather conditions, keeping an army of customer service agents can put a serious drain on the economics of running an airline.</p>
                    
                    <p>Further complexity comes from chunks of information that reside with different personnel at different locations, like ground staff, airport staff, airline staff, vendors, contractors, government authorities who are handling security etc., making aviation one of the most difficult industries when it comes information sensitivity and security. Airlines are caught up between keeping customers happy with quick service and being meticulous with following rules.</p>
                    
                    <p>The information retrieval system used by most airlines do not help either. Most airline customer service desk use keyword-based searches using tools like Sharepoint or other tag-based searches for reference. Therefore, the accuracy of the results is subject to using the right keywords.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Chatbots for Better Customer Engagement</b></p>
                    
                    <p>Chatbot technology has been evolving rapidly as a way to address some of the concerns listed above. Chatbots not only do an excellent job of retrieving information at top speed, they allow questions to be asked in natural language rather than relying on keywords.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the technology evolves, chatbots are rapidly growing in popularity, especially since they can communicate through existing messaging apps on smartphones. Several studies show that messaging apps are the most widely used smartphone apps today. Statistics indicate that in 2018, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger had over 1.3 billion monthly users, while WeChat had 980 million monthly active users1. Chatbots work well because people are generally reluctant to download any special app for communication with airlines.         </p>
