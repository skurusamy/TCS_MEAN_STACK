                    <p>Picture these - A disabled man struggling to cross the road. A child in a government school sitting on the floor hunched over his books. An asthmatic young biker using an inhaler at the traffic signal.</p>

                    <p>When faced with such realities, we often feel empathy but how often do we think of finding a solution that will make their lives better?</p>
                    
                    <p>This story is about people who did precisely that. Social innovators who are attempting to make a difference to the lives of people around us, with their unique solutions.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Inspiration behind Aarohan, a Social Innovation Award
                     
                    <p>And that’s when ‘Aarohan’ was conceptualized, a unique program that provides a platform for social entrepreneurs to gain recognition, mentorship, and the opportunity to scale up.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here are a few excerpts from our conversation with Mrs. Sudha Murty and the vision behind the program that shifts the focus from social service to building sustainable social change.</p>
                    
                
                    <p>The chance discovery of an ingenious roti making device at a community kitchen that I was visiting, led me to think that here was an opportunity to encourage more of social entrepreneurship. So far, the Foundation was using its funds only to run social projects. What if this fund could also be used to uncover the work that thousands of social innovators are already doing across India and enable them to be self-reliant?</p>
                    
                    <p>We decided to launch the Aarohan Social Innovation Awards, It is a competitive platform inviting submissions from individuals, teams, and NGOs who are working on developing unique solutions across India for various challenges in the social sector.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cash prizes totaling to Rs 1.7 crores (17 million INR) were announced for the winners with an 8-week mentorship program at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad. Through these awards, we are providing institutional support to the winners to help them scale their innovations.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>We had over 900 entries with a lot of great work being done in the following six areas – healthcare, rural development, education and sports, women’s safety and empowerment, destitute care, and sustainability. There is still a lot of opportunity in the medical field, where affordable, small, and simple instruments could make a big difference to large sets of population. For example, we found this young team who had designed an anti-pollution mask that also served as an automated drug delivery device. This was a small invention but it could make a radical impact on people suffering from respiratory ailments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Similarly today, with more and more people abandoning farming, any invention that can help farmers reduce their dependency on physical human labor will bring a lot of value.</p>
