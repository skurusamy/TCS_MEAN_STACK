                    Early Focus on Data – A Key Strategy for CIS Implementation Success</div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>From our long association with Customer Information System (CIS) transformation programs across multiple utilities, we have observed that most believe a successful CIS transformation is driven by adopting the right technology and business processes. They often overlook the criticality of data transformation in such programs. Those who have been part of complex CIS implementations will know that data is often the long pole in such programs, yet the focus shifts to data mainly during the design phase. This is too late in the program lifecycle and introduces significant risks to the program’s subsequent phases (testing coming to a halt because of lack of data) and overall success (incorrect bills being sent out to customers, post go live). An early focus on data, while helping mitigate risks, can also accelerate timelines and enhance quality. As we say, a new CIS system can only be as good as the data in it.</p>

                    <p>How do utilities ensure that their data is ready to play the pivotal role it must, towards successful CIS implementations? By focusing early in the program on all the aspects of data - from strategy and planning, to data quality and conversion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Making data an early focus in your CIS program</p>
                    
                    <p>The pre-program initiation Period – Data source identification and cleansing</p>
                    <p>Even before a System Integrator (SI) is selected for a CIS implementation, utility companies should start identifying its sources/systems of data that will be decommissioned. While major sources are often known like a large mainframe billing system, there are often smaller but significant source systems, maintained independently by business users in the form of access databases or excel sheets that hold important data and are required by the new CIS system. Inventorying, documenting and removing redundancies in data sources is the first step for an early focus.</p>
                    
                    <p>Data cleansing is most effective when done early and directly at the source. Master data like customer and account, or meters and site are often the low hanging fruits for cleansing. For example, if there are email addresses missing for few hundred customers, an outreach campaign can help gather the missing data and update the source systems. Similarly, we often notice Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data gets stored in non-PII fields – like a driver’s license or social security number is saved in the notes fields by call centers. This data, if migrated as-is, can cause audit and compliance concerns in the new CIS system and therefore should be taken up for cleansing early in the process.</p>
                    
                   <p> Data cleansing at source acts as a pilot for establishing the data cleansing methodology that can then be easily repeated for higher volumes of cleansing during the CIS program.       </p>
