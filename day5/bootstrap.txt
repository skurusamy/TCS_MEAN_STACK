    2. md ---> medium screen devices
    3. xl ---> Extra large desktop screen
    4. lg ---> large device.

col-sm | col-lg | col-xl ===> the way to represent.

Boostrap have 2 types of layout 
    1. Fixed Layout   => all elements will be wrapped in a container with the proper alignment 
                      => It will always be a certain width, and when we resize pur browser it will not adjust
    2. Fluid Layout   => takes complete space of the application

<meta> tag is important.... has name="viewport" content="width=device-width // takes complete width of the device used,initial-scale = 1"[zoom=100%]
